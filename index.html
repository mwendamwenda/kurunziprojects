        <p>The world is over taken by a digital age. Everywhere you go you see adults, teenagers and children 
        walking around with their eye on a screen instead of the world around them. Even in museums, displaying our 
        creative history, children only pay attention to their smartphones. But can we blame them? Looking at a still
         image on the wall or battling spaceships with a tiny screen in your hands, thatâ€™s an easy choice for a child.
